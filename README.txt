R PROGRAMS

These projects are my R programs for direct mail campaigns to clean donor lists.

PREREQUISITES

The users should have R installed on his/her machine. Due to privacy concerns the test data is not actual, and much of the information has been redacted. There is, however, enough information to run this script successfully.

RUN

To run the program, the user should see each scripts USER DOCUMENTATION.
