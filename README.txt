R PROGRAMS

These projects are my R programs for direct mail campaigns to clean donor lists. I have also included an example of my code that includes use of SQL, tidyverse packages (tidyr, dplyr, lubridate, tidytext, stringr, ggplot2) and some regression analysis, with time series graphs. I provided neither raw data nor output from this program (StaffCommunications).

PREREQUISITES

The users should have R installed on his/her machine. Due to privacy concerns the test data is not actual, and much of the information has been redacted. There is, however, enough information to run the MOM18 script successfully.
